- What I learned

| # | Date       | Tool    | Prompt (summary) | Output (summary) | My Edits & Modifications | What I Learned |
|---|------------|---------|------------------|------------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| 1 | 2025-12-09 | ChatGPT | Asked for help designing the structure and starter code for my Assignment 4 portfolio (HTML, CSS, JS, docs). | Suggested full file structure, starter HTML/CSS/JS, README, technical documentation, and AI usage template. | I changed all placeholder text, added my real name and real projects, customized colors, adjusted layout, and reviewed all code comments. I also removed or simplified parts that I didn't need. | How to structure a portfolio project, organize CSS variables for theming, and write clear technical and AI-usage documentation. |
| 2 | yyyy-mm-dd | (Tool)  | (What I asked)   | (What it gave)   | (How I edited/checked it) | (New concept I understood better) |

## Benefits of AI

- Helped generate an initial layout and structure quickly.
- Provided ideas for features such as theme toggle and project filters.
- Assisted in drafting documentation, which I then edited and personalized.

## Challenges

- AI sometimes produced more code than I needed; I had to simplify.
- I needed to carefully read and understand all code to avoid relying on it blindly.
- Ensuring that the result matched course requirements and my own style.

## Learning Outcomes

- Better understanding of responsive layouts using CSS Grid and Flexbox.
- Learned how to implement dark/light theme toggling with `localStorage`.
- Improved my ability to review, adapt, and refactor AI-generated code.
- Practiced transparent and ethical reporting of AI usage.
